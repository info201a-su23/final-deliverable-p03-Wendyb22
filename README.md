# Introduction
Gun violence has always been an urgent issue for the U.S. As incidents of gun misuse and gun violence continue to rise, the entire nation is seeking answers. We are no exception. Our study revolves around the changes and differences in gun violence incidents over different periods and regions, as well as the broad implications for public safety. Central to our exploration are three key questions: 
1. How has the number of gun violence incidents changed over time in different states and cities?  
2. Does gun violence differ by state? 
3. Does gun violence data analysis for each US state indicate a significant public safety threat?
To address these questions, we utilize a detailed dataset from Kaggle ("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmanuelfwerr/gun-violence-incidents-in-the-usa") to track gun violence incidents from 2013 to 2022, including details such as the date, location, and number of casualties. By revealing the geographic and temporal dynamics of gun violence, we aim to understand potential factors to build safer communities. However, navigating and analyzing this dataset poses significant challenges. Given that we're dealing with real tragedies, we have a responsibility to protect the privacy of victims and involved parties. Moreover, our investigation needs to respect the facts and be mindful of potential biases that might arise during the data collection process, as well as ethical considerations.
